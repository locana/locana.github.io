<p><strong>First of all, please update your camera’s firmware or Smart Remote Control application to the LATEST one.</strong></p>

<p>In some models, shipping version software does not support remote control by 3rd party applications, even if it is listed as supported device.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Camera Apps models requires install of Smart Remote Control app at PlayMemories Camera Apps store from your camera or PC.
Note that <strong>almost all of pre-installed app are incompatible with Scrap</strong>.</li>
  <li>QX10/100 and AS15 requires firmware update from your PC.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, some models <strong>cannot be supported</strong> because of API restriction of camera device.
On those devices, it seems that only Sony’s official application can access API.
The followings are well-known incompatible camera devices</p>

<ul>
  <li>RX100M2</li>
  <li>HX50</li>
