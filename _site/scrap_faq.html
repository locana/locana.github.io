<h3 id="how-to-install">How to install?</h3>

<p>Our application “Scrap” is available on <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/scrap/896b0e1b-2c1a-40e4-9c55-09050e3860dc">Windows Phone Apps Store</a>.</p>

<p>Windows Phone 8.0 and 8.1 are supported.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use">How to use?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Launch remote control mode on your camera device.
    <ul>
      <li>Camera Apps models (E-mount, RX100M3 etc.): Launch “Smart Remote Control” app from application menu</li>
      <li>Action cam, QX series: Turn Wi-Fi on</li>
      <li>Others: Launch “Control with Smartphone” from menu</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Connect your phone and camera from Wi-Fi setting of your phone
    <ul>
      <li>Note that your camera will appear on the access point list as “DIRECT-<strong>**</strong>**:HDR-AS30V”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Launch Scrap app on your phone.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wi-fi-is-connected-but-it-doesnt-work-well">Wi-Fi is connected, but it doesn’t work well</h3>
<p><strong>First of all, please update your camera’s firmware or Smart Remote Control application to the LATEST one.</strong></p>

<p>In some models, shipping version software does not support remote control by 3rd party applications, even if it is listed as supported device.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Camera Apps models requires install of Smart Remote Control app at PlayMemories Camera Apps store from your camera or PC.
Note that <strong>almost all of pre-installed app are incompatible with Scrap</strong>.</li>
  <li>QX10/100 and AS15 requires firmware update from your PC.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, some models <strong>cannot be supported</strong> because of API restriction of camera device.
On those devices, it seems that only Sony’s official application can access API.
The followings are well-known incompatible camera devices</p>

<ul>
  <li>RX100M2</li>
  <li>HX50</li>
  <li>WX80, WX200, WX300 </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-transfer-photos-or-movies-from-camera">How to transfer photos or movies from camera?</h3>
<p>About photos,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Currently, our application supports very limited models (AZ1, QX30, and QX1).</li>
  <li>For the other models, please try DLNA client apps published on the App Store.
It seems that some of DLNA control point application can fetch contents from Sony’s camera devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>About movies</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transferring movie is hard to implement because saving movie to phone’s storage is not supported on Windows Phone.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nfc-does-not-work">NFC does not work</h3>

<p>Make sure the followings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NFC setting of phone device.</li>
  <li>NFC setting of camera device. (Is NFC icon (like “N” character) displayed on the screen?)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="too-few-functions">Too few functions</h3>
<p><strong>Please update your camera’s firmware or Smart Remote Control application to the LATEST one.</strong></p>

<p>If you’re already using the latest one, what you are seeing on this application is what your camera device provide.
<a href="https://developer.sony.com/develop/cameras/">See Sony’s official documentation.</a></p>

<h3 id="too-low-framerate">Too low framerate</h3>
<p>It might be caused by phone’s CPU performance.
Please try to turn off histogram display.</p>
