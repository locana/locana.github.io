## FAQ about Locana

### How to install?

Now it's available on the Windows phone store for WP8.1 devices. Search "Locana".

For Windows 8.1, wait a while.

### How to use?
1. Launch remote control mode on your camera device.
  + Camera Apps models (E-mount, RX100M3 etc.): Launch "Smart Remote Control" app from application menu
  + Action cam, QX series: Turn Wi-Fi on
  + Others: Launch "Control with Smartphone" from menu
2. Connect your phone and camera from Wi-Fi setting of your phone
  + Note that your camera will appear on the access point list as "DIRECT-********:HDR-AS30V".
3. Launch Locana app on your phone.

### Wi-Fi is connected, but it doesn't work well
**First of all, please update your camera's firmware or Smart Remote Control application to the LATEST one.**

In some models, shipping version software does not support remote control by 3rd party applications, even if it is listed as supported device.

- Camera Apps models requires install of Smart Remote Control app at PlayMemories Camera Apps store from your camera or PC.
Note that **almost all of pre-installed app are incompatible with Locana**.
- QX10/100 and AS15 requires firmware update from your PC.

Unfortunately, some models **cannot be supported** because of API restriction of camera device.
On those devices, it seems that only Sony's official application can access API.
The followings are well-known incompatible camera devices

- RX100M2
- HX50
- WX80, WX200, WX300 

### How to transfer photos or movies from camera?

#### AS200V, X1000V, AZ1, QX30, and QX1
1. Connect to camera normally, and open playback page.
2. Just swipe right to see your contents in the camera.
3. You can see/download photos and see movie on streaming.

#### For E-mount models and fixed lens models

1. Select "Send to Smartphone" from the camera's menu.
2. Connect to the camera, and launch Locana
3. Open Gallery, and swipe right.

It seems that deleting contents by this method is prohibited and playing movie on stream is not supported.


### NFC does not work

Make sure the followings, then launch Locana app. again:

- NFC setting of phone device.
- NFC setting of camera device. (Is NFC icon (like "N" character) displayed on the screen?)

### Too few functions
**Please update your camera's firmware or Smart Remote Control application to the LATEST one.**

If you're already using the latest one, what you are seeing on this application is what your camera device provide.
