## FAQ about SCRAP

### How to install?

Our application "Scrap" is available on [Windows Phone Apps Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/scrap/896b0e1b-2c1a-40e4-9c55-09050e3860dc).

Windows Phone 8.0 and 8.1 are supported.

### How to use?
1. Launch remote control mode on your camera device.
  + E-mount models, RX100M3 etc.: Launch "Smart Remote Control" app from application menu
  + Action cam, QX series: Turn Wi-Fi on
  + Others: Launch "Control with Smartphone" from menu
2. Connect your phone and camera from Wi-Fi setting of your phone
  + Note that your camera will appear on the access point list as "DIRECT-********:HDR-AS30V".
3. Launch Scrap app on your phone.

### Wi-Fi is connected, but it doesn't work well
**First of all, update your camera's firmware or Smart Remote Control application to the LATEST one.**

- Almost all of **pre-installed** Smart Remote Control app are incompatible with 3rd party applications.
- QX10/100 and AS15 requires firmware update to be compatible with 3rd party applications.

### How to transfer photos or movies from camera?
About photos,

- Currently, our application supports very limited models (AZ1, QX30, and QX1).
- For the other models, please try DLNA client apps published on the App Store.
It seems that some of DLNA control point application can fetch contents from Sony's camera devices.

About movies

- Transferring movie is hard to implement because saving movie to phone's storage is not supported on Windows Phone.

### NFC does not work

Make sure followings:

- NFC is enabled on phone's NFC setting
- NFC is enabled on camera. (Is NFC icon (like "N" character) displayed on the screen?)

### Too few available settings
**Please update your camera's firmware or Smart Remote Control application to the LATEST one.**

If you're already using the latest one, displayed settings may be all of the supported functions on your camera.
[See Sony's official documentation.](https://developer.sony.com/develop/cameras/)

### Too low framerate
It might be caused by phone's CPU performance.
Please try to turn off histogram display.
