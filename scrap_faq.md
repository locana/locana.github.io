## FAQ about SCRAP

### How can I install?

Our application "Scrap" is available on [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/scrap/896b0e1b-2c1a-40e4-9c55-09050e3860dc).

Windows Phone 8.0 or later is supported.

### How can I use?
1. Launch remote controll mode or turn Wi-Fi on.
  + E-mount models, RX100M3 etc.: Launch Smart Remote app from application menu
  + Action cam, QX series: Turn Wi-Fi on
  + Others: Launch Control with Smartphone from menu
2. Connect to your camera from Wi-Fi setting on your phone
  + Note that your camera will be appeared like "DIRECT-********:HDR-AS30V" on your list of access point
3. Launch Scrap app.

### Wi-Fi is connected, but it doesn't start or liveview is not visible
**First of all, update your camera's firmware or Smart Remote application to the LATEST one.**

- Most of Camera apps supported models (E-mount models, or RX100M3) has incompatible application as pre-installed one.
- QX10/100 and AS15 requres firmware update to be accessible with our application.

### How to transfer photos or movies from my camera?
Transferring movie is hard to implement because saving movie to phone's storage is not supported on Windows Phone.

For photos, currently, it's supported on very limited models (AZ1, QX30, and QX1).

From the other models, please try to use DLNA client app. It seems that some of DLNA control point application can fetch contents from Sony's camera models.

### NFC is not working

Make sure followings:

- NFC is allowed by your phone's setting
- NFC is turned on on the camera. (When NFC is available, NFC icon (like "N" character) is displayed on the screen.)

### Too few available settings
**Please install the latest SmartRemote application from Playmemories camera apps, or use latest camera's firmware.**

If you're already using it, settings which displayed may be all of supported functions. [See official documentation.](https://developer.sony.com/develop/cameras/)

### Too low framerate
It might be caused by phone's performance. Please try to turn off histogram display.
